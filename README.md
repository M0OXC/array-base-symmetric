## 📖 Introduction

Symmetric arrays are a unique data structure where the elements mirror each other. This can be useful in various applications, such as mathematical computations, graphics, and data storage. The **Array Base Symmetric** library provides a set of tools to create, manipulate, and analyze these arrays effectively.

## ✨ Features

- **Create Symmetric Arrays**: Easily generate symmetric arrays with predefined sizes.
- **Manipulate Elements**: Add, remove, or modify elements while maintaining symmetry.
- **Matrix Operations**: Perform standard matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication on symmetric arrays.
- **Nested Structures**: Support for nested symmetric arrays for complex data representation.
- **Utility Functions**: Various utility functions to check symmetry, transpose matrices, and more.

## 🚀 Installation

To get started with **Array Base Symmetric**, you need to install it via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install array-base-symmetric
```

## 🔧 Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the **Array Base Symmetric** library:

```javascript
const { createSymmetricArray, addElement } = require('array-base-symmetric');

// Create a 3x3 symmetric array
const symmetricArray = createSymmetricArray(3);

// Add an element
addElement(symmetricArray, 5, 1, 1);
console.log(symmetricArray);
```

This code snippet creates a symmetric array and adds an element to it. The library takes care of maintaining symmetry automatically.

## 📚 API Reference

### createSymmetricArray(size)

Creates a symmetric array of the given size.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `size` (Number): The size of the symmetric array.
- **Returns**: A symmetric array.

### addElement(array, value, row, col)

Adds an element to the specified position in the symmetric array.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `array` (Array): The symmetric array.
  - `value` (Any): The value to add.
  - `row` (Number): The row index.
  - `col` (Number): The column index.

### checkSymmetry(array)

Checks if the given array is symmetric.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `array` (Array): The array to check.
- **Returns**: Boolean indicating whether the array is symmetric.
